# You stayed quietly at home alone.
<center>
In your mind, such a scene pops up. <br>
A seasoned warrior, who seems to have been through countless battles, earnestly says to you, <br></center>
"<br>They are so objective, so trustworthy. <br>
They are the materials that compose the dragon-slaying sword. <br>
Listen to their language, <br>
abstract it into thoughts, and then condense the thoughts into a sharp blade.<br>
Then you can defeat him."<br><br>
<center>
You recall a conversation with the veteran
â€”a person with simple yet gorgeous makeup,
a well-nourished figure,
and a carefree appearance. <br>
He calmly tells you, <br></center>
"<br>He is my enemy and yours as well.<br>
He is looks harmless, expressionless,<br>
He is like a friend who will always accompany you."<br><br>
<center>
He gazes into the distance, furrowing his brows slightly, and says, <br></center>
"<br>He is called 'Boredom', <br>
my lifelong archenemy. <br>
He acts arbitrarily and scorns everything about me."<br><br>
<center>
At this moment, he looks at his calloused and scarred hand, muttering to himself, <br></center>
"<br>Perhaps he just wants to attach himself to me. <br>
Under certain conditions, he would unhesitatingly devour my mind.<br> Sometimes I don't even think it's him doing it."<br><br>
<center>
The veteran slowly takes out a heavy cloth bag from his waist, filled with gold bars, and places it on the table, saying,<br></center>
"<br>I have plenty of experience in resisting him. <br>
I was tried to respond to him with material possessions and pleasure.<br>
After receiving them, he would indeed leave satisfied."<br><br>
<center>
Suddenly, the veteran lifts his head and turns to you, locking eyes with you in a fiery gaze: <br></center>
"<br>Friend, you cannot silently allow him to do this without any ambition!<br>
Some thoughts endure for thousands of years in various forms of expression,<br>
do you know why?"<br><br>
<center>
The veteran slowly draws a beautiful sword from a plain scabbard and suddenly thrusts it into the gold bars on the table, piercing through multiple bars and directly into the table. <br></center>
"<br>When you hear his mockery and groans, it means that carefree days have returned!"<br><br>
<center>
You stare at the sword with a puzzled expression, and the veteran smiles,<br></center>
"<br>Do you want to borrow my sword?<br>
No, I won't lend it to you. <br>
It's not because I'm reluctant, but because everyone must confront their own 'Boredom'. <br>
You must face your own war."<br><br>
<center>
Seeing your disappointed expression, the veteran looks up at the sky and says,<br></center>
"<br>But I will never be stingy with using my thoughts to slowly solidify into the material for the sword."<br><br>
<center>
Suddenly, a fierce wind blows outside, pushing open the door. <br>
The veteran slowly gets up, pats your shoulder, and says,<br> </center>
"<br>It won't be long before he comes to find you. <br>
If you don't want to empty your belongings and become completely enslaved by him, 
<br>**go and forge your sword.**"<br>
