## ~~The Characteristics Of The Suspect~~
<center> A man with round glasses, messy hair, and some unshaven stubble, walks towards you in small steps. <br>He is breathing heavily, as if he has been running. He takes a moment to catch his breath, adjusts his glasses, and then speaks to you:<br></center>
“<br>
Hello **boss**, I am your **assistant**.<br> We have been investigating the unauthorized opening of a portal to **alternate world**. <br> Here are the photos I took while infiltrating the **suspect**'s house: ”<br>

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/HomePhoto.png" background-color="transparent" width="350"/>
“<br>
Most of them are books and magazines related to games, covering everything from production to design. <br>
There is a significant portion dedicated to the fields of Anthropology, Design, and Psychology. <br>
The remaining books cover over 20 research fields, all related to game studies.<br><br>

I doubt if he really has the time to finish all these books?<br>
I have been observing this guy for several days, and I'm almost inseparable from him.<br><br>
This guy is often alone, looking like he's thinking about something.<br> Sometimes he suddenly bursts into laughter. <br>He's definitely a strange person. <br>
The two books he often carries with him are [The Art of Game Design](https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design) and [Rule Of Play](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262240451/rules-of-play/)，both of which he has almost worn out from reading.”<br><br>
<!-- 疑问 -->

<center>After a while, the assistant felt a little awkward when seeing no response from you, and said:<br></center>
“<br>
Do I need to continue reporting the information about the suspect?”<br>
<center>You gestured with your eyes for the assistant to continue speaking.<br></center><br>

## ~~The Educational Background of The Suspect~~

<center>The assistant takes a stack of documents out of his briefcase and hands them to you, saying:<br></center>
“<br>
His undergraduate study was completed at the [University of Central Lancashire](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/) in the UK, majoring in Animation, and he obtained a Second Class degree.<br>It's quite a luxurious journey for a Chinese person to study abroad.”<br>
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/Undergraduate.png" background-color="transparent" width="350"/><br><br>
“<br>
I infiltrated his previous residence and found some other items related to his educational background. <br>
There were a bunch of old-looking paintings at his home, along with some junior high and high school graduation certificates.<br>
I was afraid of missing any useful information, so I took pictures of everything.”<br>
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/HighSchool.png" background-color="transparent" width="450"/><br><br>
<center>You seem a bit impatient and say:<br></center>
“<br>
These certificates all look like they are about to get moldy.”<br><br>
<center>Assistant scratched his head apologetically while nodding, and reorganized the documents. <br>After some sifting, he put some documents back on the desk, took out one of the graduation certificates, and said: <br></center>
“<br>
10 years ago, he studied for 3 years at a Chinese university called [Jiangnan University](https://english.jiangnan.edu.cn/) in China.<br>
His major was digital media art.<br>
This university was established by the Chinese government to meet the challenges of the new technological revolution in the 21st century.<br>
His graduation project at that time was an independent game. <br>It's quite sad that after 10 years, he still hasn't produced a successful work. ”<br>
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/UndergraduateChina.png" background-color="transparent" width="450"/><br><br>

<center>You glanced over the documents, while the assistant opened the computer, manipulated it, placed it on the table, and turned to you, saying: <br></center>
“<br>
I have also collected some self-study materials he pursued after starting work. <br>
There are some similar online courses.<br>Do you want me to show them to you? ”<br>
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/cppEdu.png" background-color="transparent" width="450"/><br><br>

<center>You looked at the online course certificates on the computer, stroked your chin, and waved your hand, indicating him to present the next item.<br></center>
<center>The assistant took out several data folders from the briefcase, contemplated for a while, and eventually pulled out a graduation diploma, saying:<br></center>
“<br>
He obtained a master's degree in game design from [Kingston University London](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) London in the UK.<br>
I think this is the most impressive diploma he has.”<br>
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/MasterDegree.png" background-color="transparent" width="350"/><br><br>

<center>You glanced around and gestured that he could proceed to the next stage.<br></center><br>

## ~~Criminal motive:~~
<center>The assistant paused for a moment, as if recalling a certain scene in his mind, and then said:<br></center>
“<br>
In order to understand his motive for the crime, I visited his former supervisors.<br>Here's how they evaluated the suspect:<br>”
<center>The assistant cleared his throat and adopted a more confident posture before saying:<br></center>
“<br>
I acknowledge his passion for gaming.<br>
He once said to me:<br>
‘Game design is the best tool for materializing ideas in this era. <br>
This exquisite tool is worthy of dedicating a lifetime to research and iteration,<br>
to present ideas that are worth being passed down for a thousand years.’<br>
How wonderful it is!”<br>
<center>The assistant finished speaking and waited for your response. <br> A subtle hint of disdain flashed across your face, barely noticeable, but the assistant caught it.<br>He immediately changed his posture and said:<br></center>
“<br>
Clearly without any achievements, it is quite overestimating oneself!”<br>

## ~~Achievements and Honors~~
<center>The assistant furrowed his brow slightly, as if encountering some difficulty, and said:<br></center>
“<br>
I have not collected any information about achievements. It's my negligence. <br>
However, according to his friends, he has won many awards.<br>
But this person seems to attach little importance to fame and status.<br>
He once gave away the medals he had won, exchanging them for a cup of coffee with his friends.<br>
This incident was confirmed by the owner of the coffee shop downstairs from his house.”<br>
<center>The assistant finished speaking and looked at you as if waiting for your response. <br> After a moment, you nodded to indicate that he should continue.<br></center>

## Suspect’s Personal Skills
<center>The assistant's face displayed a barely perceptible smile, exuding confidence. <br> He operated the computer, opened the command line, entered some commands, and then turned the computer towards you.<br></center>
“<br>
After accessing the projects he has worked on and integrating multiple assessment tools, I analyzed his most proficient skills and put them into this pie chart.”<br>
<center>The numbers on the display screen kept fluctuating, appearing to be updating in real time, until gradually coming to a stop and displaying the following values:<br></center>

### Pie Chart

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/Skills.png" background-color="transparent" width="450"/><br><br>

<!-- ```mermaid

    "Game_Design" : 65
    "3D_Animation" : 60
``` -->

<center>You looked for a while, nodded, and the assistant felt that you were very satisfied with the information he provided, so he said:<br></center>
“<br>
Since the boss seldom visits, I need to present some more valuable information.”<br>

--- 

## ~~Independent game project~~
<center>The assistant turned the computer towards itself again, opened the command line, entered some commands, then handed the computer to you and said:<br></center>
“<br>
As shown in the flow chart.<br>
He currently has two completed independent game projects.<br>
One is a Tetris variant, and the other is a match-three variant.<br>
The Tetris variant has not been released, but has been playtested offline and received some player feedback.<br>
The match-three variant has been released, but has not gained much attention.”<br>

### Flow Chart

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/src/assets/img/portfolio/Plans_EN.png" background-color="transparent" width="450"/><br><br>

<center>Your attention is drawn to "More" in the bottom right corner of the Flow Chart, and you click the link.<br>What appears in front of you is an introduction to the first game.<br>Since it's a mobile game, you stand the assistant's computer vertically on the desk.</center>

    "
    8  The derivation process of Constituative Rules : 
    "
    In battle, there are 6 different unit types.

    During the battle, a total of 6 * 12 squares can be occupied, with each square having two states: occupied and unoccupied. Since half of the squares belong to the opponent and dealing damage calculates the number of squares that can be occupied to be 6 * 6.

    Because each square has different tactics for being occupied or unoccupied, there can be up to 2^36 possibilities, which is 68,719,476,736 possibilities.

    Therefore, there are 68,719,476,736 * 6 = 412,316,860,416 possibilities in a single turn.

<center>You press the space bar on the computer keyboard, causing two video playback windows to pop up. <br> Without waiting for the assistant to explain, you select a node with faster internet speed and drag the progress bar:<br></center>

    1 Project development cycle :

    June 2023 - November 2023
    "
    2 Project purpose : 
    "
    One-time project.
    Practical application of game design theory.
    This is the predecessor of the first game.
    I found that the match-three gameplay is a simplified variant of Tetris.
    That's why I attempted to challenge the variant of match-three gameplay.
    "
    3 Player operating rules : 
    "
    Tactical thinking => Click to deploy => Observe the results
    "
    4 Implicit rules of game :

    Players have 185,794,560 possibilities for their actions in a 10 * 20 discrete space,
    with the ultimate victory or defeat determined by the number of squares occupied.
    "
    8 The derivation process of Constituative Rules : 
    "
    In the construction phase, 
    due to 4 blocks with 4 unit options each that can be repeated, 
    there are 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 combinations.
    
    During the construction phase, 
    up to 4 units can be deployed in a 3x3 grid. 
    The first block has 9 placement options, 
    the second block has 8 options, 
    the third has 7, 
    and the fourth has 6. 
    Therefore, the total number of placement methods is 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 3024.
    
    During gameplay, 
    there are 4 possible block orientations.
    
    During gameplay, 
    there is a time limit of 180 seconds. 
    A new block appears every three seconds, 
    allowing for a maximum of 60 blocks to appear.

    In summary, 
    there are 256 * 3024 * 4 * 60 = 185,794,560 possible permutations.

<center>You stared at the screen, silently thinking to yourself:<br>Is this the **alternate world** entrance created by the suspect? <br>Based on your experience, there are still many issues even when looking at the core mechanics of the game, and you began to contemplate where the problem lies.<br></center>
<center>Your thoughts were interrupted by the assistant's quiet cough, indicating that the assistant had been waiting for a while. <br>You gestured for him to continue.</center>

## ~~Suspect’s work experience~~
<center>The assistant handed over the prepared documents to you and said:</center>
“<br>
I visited all the companies where he had previously worked, all of which were related to game technology, except for a six-month temporary job in the UK, he had been working in China. <br>
It's strange that every time he reached the pinnacle of his performance, he would jump to the next company. <br> Combining this with his later independent game studio work, it's easy to see that he was treating his jobs as stepping stones, very selfish indeed.<br>
But surprisingly, every company gave him very high evaluations.<br>
His last monthly salary reached 30,000 RMB, which is a very high salary in China in 2023.<br>
This is the suspect's own description, and below is the information I have compiled.”<br><br>

<center>After you finished reviewing the documents, you noticed that the assistant was already packing up his briefcase.<br>When he saw that you had finished reviewing the materials, he began to speak as he continued to tidy up.</center>
“<br>
However, from the recent investigation into the suspect's financial transactions, it appears that his savings have been depleted in order to run the studio.<br>Nevertheless, his passive income covers his living expenses each month.<br>
 Despite this, he appears happy and relaxed every day, continuing to develop independent games. <br>It's truly puzzling.<br>
With his unwavering dedication, it seems that someday he will succeed in opening the gateway to **alternate world**.<br>
That's all the information I have on his investigation.<br>Is there anything else I can help you with?”<br>

<center>You shook your head.<br>The assistant then stood up, bowed to you, and left the office.<br>You stared at the documents he left behind, <br>contemplating the suspect you had constructed in your mind.</center>
